Menu open f2 for Lj ahk. Del key for exit AHK. 

The script has a function to save settings your settings will be saved in settings.ini the configuration file is created automatically in the location of the script.

I advise typing prestrafe 276 mainly via +w then before the edge of the block hold down space and at the end ctrl.

RMB has the same function as space, but without strafe it allows you to make long jumps without strafe, always pressing perfect +W
